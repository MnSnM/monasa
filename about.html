        <p>Other than that, I have been hard at work on gaining experience within a diverse team of network engineers in a well run ICT unit for my day to day. This motivates me to keep at enhancing my understanding through, not only research and development and further study, but also through practical implementation. I do enjoy the learning process as well, There is a definite spark in learning just what it takes to make our digital age, modern world go round. Not just in how we optimize our work, but now also our leisure and play.</p>
        <p>I'm Currently studying for the next certification on my radar: the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Archictect track. Yet another stepping-stone to expanding my exposure to the next level of networking, this time in the cloud!. After this I would like to pursue deeper knowledge in networking and IT as a whole. See where the journey will take me. I have to admit, This has been a rather exciting path so far, and I look forward to helping as many people along the way to making a success wherever they choose to make their mark.</p>
